# SmithTool Windows Build Configuration
# This file contains instructions and scripts for building on Windows

## Prerequisites

1. Install Qt 6.x for Windows (MSVC or MinGW)
   - Download from: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
   - Install Qt 6.5 or later with MSVC 2019/2022 64-bit or MinGW 64-bit

2. Install CMake 3.16 or later
   - Download from: https://cmake.org/download/

3. Install Visual Studio 2019/2022 (for MSVC build) or MinGW (for MinGW build)

## Build Steps

### Using Visual Studio (MSVC)

```powershell
# Set Qt path (adjust to your installation)
$env:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = "C:\Qt\6.5.0\msvc2019_64"

# Create build directory
mkdir build-windows
cd build-windows

# Generate Visual Studio solution
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64

# Build Release
cmake --build . --config Release

# The executable will be at: build-windows\Release\SmithTool.exe
```

### Using MinGW

```powershell
# Set Qt path (adjust to your installation)
$env:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = "C:\Qt\6.5.0\mingw_64"
$env:PATH = "C:\Qt\Tools\mingw1120_64\bin;$env:PATH"

# Create build directory
mkdir build-mingw
cd build-mingw

# Generate Makefiles
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
mingw32-make -j4

# The executable will be at: build-mingw\SmithTool.exe
```

## Deployment

After building, use Qt's windeployqt tool to collect dependencies:

```powershell
# Navigate to build output directory
cd build-windows\Release  # or build-mingw

# Run windeployqt
windeployqt --release SmithTool.exe

# This will copy all required Qt DLLs to the same directory
```

## Creating Installer

Use NSIS or Inno Setup with the provided installer script.
